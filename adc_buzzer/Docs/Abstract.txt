Project:
adc_buzzer

Hardware Requirements:
LPCXpresso Board LPC17xx
Embedded Artist LPCXpresso Base Board (Trim-pot, Speaker)
Jumper wire connecting Base Board "PIO1_2" to "PIO1_11"
The PWM signal can be probed on the Base Board pin PIO1_11
or, if use of the speaker is preferred, remove the shutdown
jumper from J33. Jumper J33 is on the large jumper strip, very close
to the speaker and RGB LED. It is labeled U10-SHUTDN / PIO3_2 J33

Project Objective:
Uses ADC input to adjust the frequency of PWM output. PWM duty
cycle is modulated via look up table using the SystemTick timer.

Project Details:
If project is built with debugging enabled, it will produce output
via semi-hosted print statements (if a debugger is detected).

Build Options:
None
