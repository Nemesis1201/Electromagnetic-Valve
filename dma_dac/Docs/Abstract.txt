Project:
LPCXpresso DMA + DAC Signal Generator

Abstract:	
This project uses the LPC17xx's GPDMA and DAC to generate
waveforms of various frequencies using a look up table.

Detail:
Refer to AN10917 "Memory to DAC data transfers using the LPC1700's DMA"
for guidelines on where DMA buffer memory should be placed.

This project makes use of four wavetables which are
transferred to the LPC17xx's DAC via the GPDMA controller.
When used on the LPCXpresso Baseboard the DAC output is
connected to the speaker. By using a spreadsheet to generate
waveforms offline, and convert them into code words for the
DAC, it becomes quite easy to use the GPDMA's linked list
based scatter-gather to produce a repetitive signal on the DAC.
The GPDMA timing for memory : peripherals is determined by the
peripheral.
 
The user can cycle through one of the four waveforms by
moving the joystick on the Baseboard left or right. The wave frequency
can be adjusted by moving the joystick up or down. Pressing the
joystick downward into the board will cause the waveform and
frequency to be reset. This example uses the DAC's counter register
to trigger the DMA to load the DAC at a constant frequency and changes
the playback frequency by changing the DMA buffer to hold longer or
shorter waves. Because the DAC is being used, single transaction
bursts are used.
 
A single linked list consisting of two nodes was used to double
buffer output data. Both nodes point to each other, causing the
GPDMA to transfer data to the DAC indefinitely.	When a new signal
is selected, the GPDMA's linked list register is polled to determine
when a transaction is complete, at that time the software will then
update the contents of one of the buffers. This process is repeated
again on the second buffer to ensure that the signal being produced
is continuous. The DMA buffer update process is only done when the
waveform or frequency is changed, leading to a low overall CPU core
utilization.
